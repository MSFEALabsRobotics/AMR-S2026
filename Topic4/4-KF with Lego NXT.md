Exercise: 1D Kalman Filter (Robotics) + Plot 3 Gaussians
Scenario

A robot moves along a straight line (1D).
You estimate its position 
𝑥
x using:

Odometry (motion model) with process noise 𝑄


A position sensor (Ultrasonic) with measurement noise 𝑅


At each time step:

Predict belief using motion

Correct belief using measurement

Plot prediction Gaussian, measurement Gaussian, and posterior Gaussian
