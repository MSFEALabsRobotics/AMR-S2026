# Exercise: 1D Kalman Filter (Robotics) + Plot 3 Gaussians
## Scenario

A robot moves along a straight line (1D).
You estimate its position 𝑥:
using:

## Odometry (motion model) with process noise 𝑄


## A position sensor (Ultrasonic) with measurement noise 𝑅


### At each time step:

Predict belief using motion

Correct belief using measurement

Plot prediction Gaussian, measurement Gaussian, and posterior Gaussian
